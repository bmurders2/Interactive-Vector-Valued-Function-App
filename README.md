# Interactive-Vector-Valued-Function-App
Interactive demo web app featuring an on-the-fly supervised trained support vector machine for regression of a vector valued function. The web app is created via the Dash ML framework. Demonstrates the advantage of leveraging Docker for data science development without installing multiple software tools and frameworks with reproducible environments.
